## Game Development [CPP]
---
A pet project to learn game development in CPP. I am using SFML library from GUI development, and I compiled this on macOS, so I am only familiar with how to build with SFML on mac.

### Build

```console
$ brew install sfml
$ make TARGET=game.cc OUTPUT=game
$ ./game
```
